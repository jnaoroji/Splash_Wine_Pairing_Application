# 23 Splash: Jenny's Wine Pairing Application (Final Project: MERN Stack Single-Page Application)

## Description

My Task was to build a MERN Single page full-stack Application. This app is a wine pairing app that responds to user input to pair wine with a user's desired meal. 
The Technologies used for this application are:

* React for the Front-End.
* Uses GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.
* Uses MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.
* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.
* Is deployed using Heroku (with data).
* Has a polished UI.
* Is responsive.
* Is interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Includes authentication (JWT).
* Protects sensitive API key information on the server.
* Uses a web manifest
* Uses a service worker for offline functionality
* Is installable
* Uses CSS, Inline Styling in JSX and Bootstrap

This wine pairing Application will showcase my work to other developers and potential employers.
